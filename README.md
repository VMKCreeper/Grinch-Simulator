# ICS3U - Computer Science CPT

### Grinch simulator
Present collecting game
Note: If the map.pkl file does not work, run the filewriter file to get map.pkl and fix the issue

**All coding done together on liveshare (extension similar to repl.it), then uploaded code to github after.**

### Group members:
- Max
- Ryan

### Groups

Being in a group means having a cohesive game theme and story. It **does not** mean using other team member's code and repurposing it as your own. Each person's contributions must be utterly unique.

There are things that are allowed to be copied. These are exampled of things that will not be marked as part of your contribution:
- Images and game assets
- The drawing of specific game characters or scenery

If you do copy someone else's code in this regard, you *must* give them an attribution with a comment as follows.

```python
# Written by Dave D.
# dave_cpt.py
for x in range(100, 500, 50):
    pygame.draw.rect(....)
# ------------------
```

## Submission
If you are in a group, only one person will sumbit on behalf of the entire group.

### Play-through Video
Each group is to submit one play-through video (Five minutes) and explain it.

### Code explanation video
Each group member is to submit a five minute explanation of their own code and how it works. You must find examples of each of the topics in the requirements. If you have too many to show, just show your best work. The video's filename *must* include your full name.

**Please note:** The code explanation video is supposed to be an explanation of your code and how it works. You must use technical language to show me you know what these concepts are. This is not a video where you only say "here is a function I wrote". See the sub-topics under the requirements for key words you should know and use.

### GitHub code
Be sure to constantly update your GitHub repository.
